# Fetch on mount

You can use `useMount` to fetch a resource on mount only.

```tsx
useMount(query) 
```

### Motivation

Use it when you DON'T want to refetch when the key changes.

### Warning

Won't fetch on key change, see [useFetch](/features/use-fetch) for doing so.

### Example

```tsx
function useHelloMount() {
  const query = useSchema(getHelloSchema, [])

  useMount(query)
  return query
}
```

### Implementation

```tsx
export function useMount(query: Query) {
  const { fetch } = query

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch()
  }, [])
}
```
