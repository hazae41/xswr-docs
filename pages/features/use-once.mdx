# Fetch only once

You can use `useOnce` to fetch a resource on mount and on key change, but only if there is no data.

```tsx
useOnce(query) 
```

### Motivation

You want to get some data once and share it in multiple components.

### Warning

Will still try to fetch if there is an error.

### Example

```tsx
function useHelloOnce() {
  const query = useSchema(getHelloSchema, [])
  useOnce(query)
  return query
}
```

### Implementation

```tsx
export function useOnce(query: Query) {
  const { data, fetch } = query

  useEffect(() => {
    if (data === undefined) fetch()
  }, [data, fetch])
}
```
