# Persistent storage

You can create a persistent storage and use it only where you want.

## Creating a storage

Create a storage either at top-level...

```tsx
import { Storage } from "@hazae41/storage"

const storage = new IDBStorage("mydb")

function getHelloSchema(storage?: Storage) {
  return getSchema<Hello>("/api/hello", fetchAsJson, { storage })
}

function useHelloMix() {
  const query = useSchema(getHelloSchema, [storage])
  useAutoFetchMixture(query)
  return query
}
```

...or using a hook.

```tsx
import { Storage } from "@hazae41/storage"

function getHelloSchema(storage?: Storage) {
  return getSchema("/api/hello", fetchAsJson, { storage })
}

function useHelloMix() {
  const storage = useIDBStorage("mydb")
  const query = useSchema(getHelloSchema, [storage])
  useAutoFetchMixture(query)
  return query
}
```

You can also pass it into a CoreProvider to enable persistent storage for all children.

```tsx
const storage = new IDBStorage("mydb")

function MyWrapper() {
  return (
    <CoreProvider storage={storage}>
      <MyApp />
    </CoreProvider>
  )
}
```

## Types of storage

### IDBStorage

- Constructor: `new IDBStorage(name)`
- Hook (static): `useIDBStorage(name)`

This storage is asynchronous and uses the browser IndexedDB.

IDBStorage is the best storage you can use:
- it's compatible with SSR
- it can store very large objects with complex graphs
- it doesn't need a serializer

Warning: Being asynchronous allows the use of SSR, but it won't display data on first render.

If you want to display data on first render, you can do so by using either:
- SyncLocalStorage
- useFallback()

### AsyncLocalStorage

- Constructor: `new AsyncLocalStorage(prefix?, serializer?)`
- Hook (static): `useAsyncLocalStorage(prefix?, serializer?)`

This storage is asynchronous and uses the browser LocalStorage.

Being asynchronous allows the use of SSR, but it won't display data on first render.

If you want to display data on first render, you can do so by using either:
- SyncLocalStorage
- useFallback()

You can set a custom prefix for all keys, by default it's `xswr:`.

You can pass a custom serializer (default is JSON) for serializing values (keys are already serialized by the `Params` serializer).

### SyncLocalStorage

- Constructor: `new SyncLocalStorage(prefix?, serializer?)`
- Hook (static): `useSyncLocalStorage(prefix?, serializer?)`

This storage is synchronous and uses the browser LocalStorage.

Being synchronous allows displaying data on first render, but it won't work with SSR.

You can set a custom prefix for all keys, by default it's `xswr:`.

You can pass a custom serializer (default is JSON) for serializing values (keys are already serialized by the `Params` serializer).
