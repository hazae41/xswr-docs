# Garbage collection

XSWR automatically delete unused data by doing reference counting and using expiration times.

Basically, a resource is garbage collected if there are no more references to it AND the expiration time has exceeded.

By default, no expiration time is set by XSWR, this means resources are NOT garbage collected by default.

[Persistent storages](/features/storage) also support automatic garbage collection out of the box.

### Resource expiration delay

You can set an expiration delay for all resources in your core provider.

```tsx
function MyWrapper() {
  return (
    <CoreProvider expiration={60 * 1000}>
      <MyAwesomeApp />
    </CoreProvider>
  )
}
```

Or you can set an expiration delay for some resource.

```tsx
function getHelloSchema() {
  return getSchema<Hello>("/api/hello", fetchAsJson, { expiration: 60 * 1000 })
}
```

### Response expiration time

You can also set an expiration time directly in your fetcher.

```tsx
async function fetchAsJson<T>(url: string, more: FetcherMore<T>) {
  const { signal } = more

  const res = await fetch(url, { signal })
  const expiration = Date.now() + (60 * 1000)

  if (!res.ok) {
    const error = new Error(await res.text())
    return { error, expiration }
  }

  const data = await res.json() as T
  return { data, expiration }
}
```

For more control, `expiration` is a time, not a delay (you must add `Date.now()` if you use a delay).

You can also use response headers like `Cache-Control` to set the expiration time accordingly.

### Tips

Use an expiration of `-1` to disable expiration.
