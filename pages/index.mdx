## Philosophy 🧠

XSWRuses two new approaches compared to other data fetching libraries like swr or react-query:
1) Encapsulating key+fetcher+params in a single abstraction called schema.
2) Composing features with very simple hooks instead of having bloated configuration and unexpected behaviors.

## Features 🔥

### Current features

- Storage agnostic caching (new Map(), LocalStorage, IndexedDB)
- Automatic refetching
- Dependent and conditional queries
- Request deduplication, cooldown, timeout, and expiration
- Page-based and cursor-based pagination
- Exponential backoff retry
- SSR & ISR support
- Optimistic mutations
- Cancellable requests
- Automatic cancellation
- Automatic garbage collection
- Per-query persistent storage
- Out of the box IndexedDB and LocalStorage
